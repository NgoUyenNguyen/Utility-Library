# State-Machine
**Base system to create a state framework, including an abstract class BaseState and an abstract class StateMachine. For using, recommend creating an intermediate abstract class State inheriting from the BaseState to add more logic.**

BASESTATE INCLUDES:
- 游릭StateKey: a key equivalent to each State for StateMachine managing
- 游댮abstract EnterState(): Methods called once when a State is entered
- 游댮abstract UpdateState(): Method called every frame while in the State
- 游댮abstract ExitState(): Methods called once when a State is exited
- 游댮abstract EState GenerateNextState(): Method to generate the next state based on the current state logic.
  
STATEMANAGER INCLUDES:
- 游릭CurrentState: The current state of the state machine
- 丘면vent OnStateChanged(fromStateKey, toStateKey): Callback fired whenever state changes
- 游댮abstract InitializeStates(): register all states by using AddStates()
- 游댮abstract InitializeEntryState(): Define the entry state
- 游릭AddStates(states): Add states to the state machine
- 游릭RemoveStates(states): Remove states from the state machine
- 游릭GetState(Estate) get state from key
- 游리virtual OnAwake(): Method is called in Awake()
- 游리virtual OnStart(): Method is called in Start()
